## LeetCode Advanced Dynamic Programming Problems
- [Cherry Pickup II:](https://leetcode.com/problems/cherry-pickup-ii/) Given a grid where each cell contains cherries, two robots start at the top row and can move down to the next row in three directions. Find the maximum number of cherries both robots can collect by the time they reach the bottom row. This problem involves 3D DP to track the positions of both robots and their collective cherry count.
- [Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule:](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/) You're given an array of integers where each integer represents the difficulty of a job, and you have to schedule the jobs in d days. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of the difficulties of each day's hardest job. Minimize the difficulty of the job schedule. This problem requires DP with partitioning optimization.
- [Stone Game IV:](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iv/) Alice and Bob play a game with stones where they take turns removing a square number of stones. The player who removes the last stone wins. Given a number of stones, determine if Alice can win the game assuming both players play optimally. This is an advanced DP problem that also involves game theory.
- [Edit Distance:](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/) Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2. Operations include insert, delete, or replace a character. It's a classic DP problem that can be optimized in various ways, including space optimization.

## Codeforces Advanced Dynamic Programming Problems
- [Caisa and Pylons:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/463/B) A problem that involves finding the minimum initial energy required to traverse a series of pylons of different heights, considering that you gain or lose energy based on the height difference between consecutive pylons. It requires a clever approach to DP or even a greedy strategy to find the optimal solution.
- [DZY Loves Sequences:](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/446/A) Given a sequence, find the maximum length of a subsequence that can become strictly increasing by changing at most one element. This problem involves DP to track the longest increasing subsequence before and after each element.
- [George and Job:](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/467/C) Given an array of integers representing pay for n days and parameters m and k, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be earned by working exactly m consecutive days k times with breaks in between. It's a problem that involves DP with cumulative sums or prefix sums for optimization.
- [Little Girl and Maximum XOR:](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/276/D) Given two integers L and R, find the maximum XOR value between any two integers in the range [L, R]. This problem can be solved using bit manipulation and DP to efficiently explore the possible XOR outcomes.
