## LeetCode Advanced String Problems
For advanced string problems on LeetCode, the focus is often on utilizing specific algorithms like suffix arrays, Manacher's algorithm, or advanced dynamic programming techniques tailored for string processing. However, LeetCode's problem set is continuously evolving, and specific "advanced strings" topics might be spread across different categories. Below are some problems that could align with advanced string processing techniques:

- ~~[Shortest Palindrome:](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/) Find the shortest palindrome in a string by adding characters to its beginning. Involves understanding of palindrome properties and possibly string manipulation techniques.~~ free with manacher + suffix reversal prepend
- ~~[Palindrome Pairs:](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/) Identify all pairs of words that form a palindrome when concatenated. Tests knowledge of string manipulation, hashing, and palindrome checking.~~ same property as ^, but actually screw this problem
- ~~[Longest Duplicate Substring:](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-duplicate-substring/) Search for the longest substring that appears at least twice. A problem that explores suffix arrays, binary search, and rolling hash techniques.~~ solved with both suffix array as well as biny + RK hash. unlocked the suffix array template ðŸ’€
- ~~[Find the Closest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/) Determine the nearest palindrome number to the given number. Challenges your understanding of numerical palindromes and string manipulation.~~ edging forever, so many edge cases. Base principle: 12345 -> 12321, self derived. Edge cases 9999..., 100...0001, 100...000, subtracting mid at '0', adding mid at '1'.

## Codeforces Advanced String Problems
Codeforces often labels its problems by contests and not by specific algorithms. Problems involving advanced string techniques could include topics like suffix automaton, string suffix structures, and complex pattern matching. Here are some problems that are considered to involve advanced string processing techniques:

- Suffix Structures: Examine if one string can be transformed into another using operations on suffixes. A deep dive into string suffixes and structural analysis.
- [Substring and Subsequence:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/919/D) Given a graph representing character transitions, find the longest path that forms a valid subsequence of characters. Merges concepts of graph theory with string processing.
- [String Game:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/779/D) A strategic game involving string removals to match a target pattern. Tests binary search and string matching skills.
- [Little Pony and Harmony Chest:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/453/C) While primarily a problem on sequences and harmony, it requires optimization techniques that can be abstracted to similar strategies used in complex string manipulation.
