## LeetCode Game Theory Problems
- [Can I Win:](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-i-win/) In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins. Given an integer maxChoosableInteger and another integer desiredTotal, determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both players play optimally.
- [Predict the Winner:](https://leetcode.com/problems/predict-the-winner/) Given an array of scores of non-negative integers representing the score of coins of a game. Two players are playing a turn-based game, where each player takes either the first or last coin from the row, and the scores are added to their total score. The player with the most score at the end wins. Determine if the first player can win the game given the condition that both players play optimally.
- [Stone Game:](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/) Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones, and there are an even number of piles arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove and take the stones from either the first or last pile. The game continues until there are no more piles left. The player with the most stones wins. Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game.
- [Cat and Mouse:](https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-mouse/) A game is played on a graph, where one player controls a mouse and another player controls a cat moving at turns. Determine whether the mouse can escape if both the cat and mouse play optimally.

## Codeforces Game Theory Problems
- [Drazil and Factorial:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/515/C) Given a number, the task is to rearrange its digits in such a way that it becomes as large as possible. However, after rearrangement, each digit of the number should be replaced by the largest factorial number less than or equal to it. This problem involves elements of combinatorics and game theory in determining the optimal arrangement.
- [Playing with Paper:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/527/A) Given two numbers representing the lengths of paper, players take turns cutting the longer piece of paper to make it equal to or smaller than the other piece. The game ends when both pieces are of equal length. The problem asks to determine the total number of cuts made by the players, showcasing strategies in a subtraction game.
- [Little Girl and Game:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/276/B) The problem is based on a game played with strings. The players take turns removing characters from the string, and the player who cannot make a move loses. This problem explores game theory concepts related to parity and winnable states in games involving string manipulation.
- Nim: A classic problem that involves the game of Nim, where players take turns removing objects from heaps or piles. The task is to apply the concept of Nim-sum and the strategy to determine the winning move, highlighting the application of XOR operations in game theory.
