## LeetCode Miscellaneous Problems
- [Random Pick with Weight:](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/) Given an array w where w[i] represents the weight of the ith index, implement a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight. This problem involves understanding of prefix sums and binary search.
- [Insert Delete GetRandom O(1):](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/) Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time: insert, delete, and getRandom, where getRandom returns a random element from current set of elements. This requires clever use of hash maps and arrays to ensure O(1) operations.
- [My Calendar I:](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/) Implement a MyCalendar class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a double booking. This problem is typically solved using balanced trees (e.g., red-black trees) or segment trees for efficient interval checking.
- [Design Excel Sum Formula:](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-excel-sum-formula/) Design the basic function of Excel and implement the function of the sum formula. The Excel class has functions like set, get, and sum. This problem requires understanding of spreadsheet computations and can be approached with graph algorithms to handle dependencies among cells.

## Codeforces Miscellaneous Problems
- [A and B and Compilation Errors:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/519/B) Given three lists of compilation errors (with one error missing in each subsequent list), find the two errors that were fixed. Efficient solution involves using hashing or bitwise operations.
- [Dreamoon and WiFi:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/476/B) Dreamoon has a sequence of moves planned in a game, but some are uncertain. Determine the probability that his uncertain plan results in the same position as the certain plan. This problem combines combinatorics and probability.
- [I Wanna Be the Guy:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/469/A) There's a game with n levels, and two players have their own list of levels they can beat. Determine if they can beat the game by combining their levels. This requires basic set operations or array manipulation.
- [Vasya and Socks:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/460/A) Vasya has n socks, and he buys a new pair every mth day. Determine how many days Vasya can continue wearing new socks. It's a straightforward problem that involves simple math or simulation.
