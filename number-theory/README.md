## LeetCode Number Theory Problems
- [Count Primes:](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/) Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n. It's a direct application of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
- [Sum of Square Numbers:](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/) Given a non-negative integer c, decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a^2 + b^2 = c. Involves understanding of the two-pointer technique or the Fermat's theorem on the sum of two squares.
- [Super Pow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-pow/) Your task is to calculate a^b mod 1337 where a is a positive integer and b is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array.
- [Happy Number:](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/) Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy". A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.

## Codeforces Number Theory Problems
- [Design Tutorial: Learn from Math:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/472/A) You are given a number n, and you need to find two composite numbers such that their sum is equal to n. This problem introduces the concept of constructing solutions in number theory through composite numbers.
- [Dreamoon and WiFi:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/476/B) This problem, while seemingly a probability problem, involves combinatorics and understanding of binomial coefficients, which are a part of number theory.
- k-LCM (easy version): Given an integer n, find three positive integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = n and the least common multiple (LCM) of a, b, and c is the minimum possible. Requires a grasp of LCM properties and number partitioning strategies.
- Vasya and Petya's Game: Vasya has invented a game of finding multiples of prime numbers up to n. This problem dives into prime numbers, multiples, and sieve techniques for generating primes.
- [DZY Loves Hash:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/447/A) This problem is centered around hashing, but it requires a good understanding of modular arithmetic and collision resolution strategies, tying back to number theory concepts.
