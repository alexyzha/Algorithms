## Key Quantum Algorithms (for fun)

**Shor's Algorithm:**
- For integer factorization, Shor's Algorithm demonstrates a significant speedup over the best-known classical factoring algorithms. It's crucial for cryptography, especially for breaking RSA encryption under the assumption that a practical quantum computer is available.

**Grover's Algorithm:**
- For searching an unsorted database or solving a black-box problem with quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. Grover's Algorithm is one of the most famous quantum algorithms and demonstrates quantum computing's potential for solving certain types of problems more efficiently than classical methods.

**Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT):**
- Fundamental for many quantum algorithms, including Shor's Algorithm. It's the quantum analogue of the discrete Fourier transform, and it plays a crucial role in quantum computing for transforming the state of a quantum system into its frequency domain.

**Quantum Phase Estimation:**
- This is used to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenstate of a quantum operation. It's a critical subroutine in many quantum algorithms, including algorithms for solving systems of linear equations and for quantum simulation.
