## LeetCode Graph Problems
- [Network Delay Time:](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/) Given times of directed edges between nodes in a network, compute how long it will take for all nodes to receive a signal sent from a starting node. Involves shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra.
- [Clone Graph:](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/) Clone a graph that is represented as an adjacency list. A good test of understanding graph traversal and cloning techniques.
- [Course Schedule:](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/) Determine if it is possible to finish all courses given prerequisite pairs. Tests knowledge of cycle detection in directed graphs using DFS or BFS.
- [Pacific Atlantic Water Flow:](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/) Find all coordinates from which water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Involves graph traversal and understanding of flow dynamics.
- [Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/) In a graph that is initially a tree with N nodes, find the edge that, if removed, results in a tree of N nodes. Tests understanding of union-find data structure or cycle detection in undirected graphs.

## Codeforces Graph Problems
- [Dijkstra?:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/20/C) Find the shortest path from the first to the last node using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, showcasing its application in a weighted graph.
- [Kefa and Park:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/580/C) DFS in a tree to find the number of paths that satisfy certain conditions. Tests tree traversal and path counting with constraints.
- [Bear and Forgotten Tree 3:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/639/C) Construct a specific type of tree or report it's impossible based on given conditions. Challenges your understanding of tree properties and construction.
- [Pasha and Graph:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/459/E) Solve a problem involving graph and paths to maximize certain criteria, testing knowledge of dynamic programming on graphs.
- [Greg and Graph:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/295/B) Given a graph, perform operations and compute sums of shortest paths. A problem that requires understanding Floyd-Warshall or similar algorithms for shortest paths in weighted graphs.
