## LeetCode Advanced Data Structures Problems
- [Count of Smaller Numbers After Self:](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/) You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i]. This problem is typically solved using Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) or a modified version of a Segment Tree to efficiently update and query the counts.
- [Design Add and Search Words Data Structure:](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/) Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string. Implement the WordDictionary class that includes methods to add a word and search a literal word or a regular expression string containing only letters a-z or .. This problem is effectively approached with a Trie data structure for efficient insertion and search.
- [Stream of Characters:](https://leetcode.com/problems/stream-of-characters/) Implement the StreamChecker class as a stream of characters where query(letter) is called to query the stream. It checks if any of the strings in the array can be formed using the last k characters received. Trie data structure with a reverse search approach or Aho-Corasick algorithm for multiple pattern matching is suitable here.

- [Karen and Coffee:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/816/B) Karen is making coffee and needs to find out how many types of coffee can reach a specific range of temperatures. This problem can be solved efficiently with segment trees or binary indexed trees (Fenwick Trees) for range queries and updates.
- [Powerful Array:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/86/D) A query problem on arrays where you need to compute the sum of powers of each number's frequency within a given range. Mo's algorithm or sqrt decomposition technique, enhanced with a Fenwick Tree for dynamic frequency tracking, is an optimal approach.
- [Sereja and Brackets:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/380/C) Given a sequence of brackets, you need to answer multiple queries about the length of the maximum correct bracket subsequence within a range. This problem is well-suited for Segment Trees to handle range queries and updates efficiently.
- [Little Girl and Maximum Sum:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/276/C) An array manipulation problem where queries specify ranges to increment elements, and you need to find the maximum sum possible of the array elements multiplied by a permutation of the integers from 1 to n. Fenwick Tree or Segment Tree with lazy propagation can be used for efficient range updates and queries.
