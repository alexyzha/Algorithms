## LeetCode Advanced Math Problems
- [Max Points on a Line:](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/) Given an array of points where each point represents a coordinate on the X-Y plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line. It tests knowledge of geometry and the application of the greatest common divisor (GCD) to reduce slope fractions.
- [Rectangle Area II:](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area-ii/) We are given a list of rectangles represented by rectangles[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2], where (xi1, yi1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (xi2, yi2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner. Calculate the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Any area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted once. This problem involves advanced geometry and the sweep line algorithm.
- [Mirror Reflection:](https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/) There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls except for one, which has a receptor. Given the room's side length and the speed at which a laser beam can travel from the emitter to the receptor at a specific angle, determine the number of the receptor that the laser beam will hit. It combines geometry with simulation or mathematical deduction.

- [Fox And Jumping:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/510/C) Given a list of cards, each with a cost and a set of forbidden indices, find the minimum cost to jump to each position using the cards. This problem requires understanding dynamic programming and bitmasking to represent subsets of cards.
- [Berland Poker:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1359/A): In a game of Berland Poker, players are dealt cards from a deck of n cards, each with a certain rank. Considering the distribution of cards and the number of jokers, calculate the maximum number of points a player can score. This problem tests combinatorics and game theory.
- [Petya and Catacombs:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/886/C) Petya explores catacombs, where each room may lead to another or back to the surface. Given a sequence representing Petya's movements, determine the minimum number of rooms in the catacombs. It involves clever counting and understanding of graph-like structures.
- [Vasya and Chess:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/493/D) Given a chessboard of a certain size, determine who will win the game under specific playing conditions, assuming both players play optimally. This problem delves into constructive algorithms, strategy, and game theory.
