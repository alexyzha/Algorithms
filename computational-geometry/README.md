## LeetCode Computational Geometry Problems
- [Max Points on a Line:](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/) Determine the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line in a 2D plane. This problem requires understanding how to define a line uniquely with equations and dealing with precision issues.
- [Rectangle Area II:](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area-ii/) Compute the total area covered by several overlapping rectangles on a plane. The challenge involves segment trees or line sweep algorithms to efficiently process the rectangles' edges.
- [The Skyline Problem:](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/) Given the locations and heights of buildings in a city skyline, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively. A classic problem solved by line sweep and priority queues to track the current highest building while scanning across the x-coordinates.

## Codeforces Computational Geometry Problems
- [Cut Ribbon:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/189/A) Although primarily a dynamic programming problem, it involves geometric intuition to maximize the number of pieces cut from a ribbon of a certain length given three possible cut lengths. It tests the understanding of partitioning in a geometric sense.
- [Wet Shark and Odd and Even:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/621/A) This problem, while not purely geometric, requires sorting and careful selection strategies that can be visualized as optimizing positions on a number line, akin to geometric reasoning.
- [Fox And Snake:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/510/A) A problem that asks for printing a specific pattern resembling a snake moving across a grid. It involves understanding geometric patterns and translating them into a programming solution.
- [Pashmak and Flowers:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/459/B) Given the beauty values of flowers, find the number of ways to choose two flowers with the maximum difference in beauty. This problem can be approached by sorting and then applying a two-pointer technique, which, while algorithmic, involves geometric thinking in terms of distances on the number line.
