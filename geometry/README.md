## LeetCode Geometry Problems
- [Erect the Fence:](https://leetcode.com/problems/erect-the-fence/) Given a list of points in the plane that represent the locations of trees, determine the outermost points that make up the boundary of the orchard. The problem can be solved using the Convex Hull algorithm (Jarvis’s March or Graham’s Scan).
- [Valid Square:](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-square/) Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, return whether the four points could construct a square. The solution involves checking distances and angles between points.
- [Rectangle Overlap:](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/) An algorithmic challenge to determine if two given rectangles overlap, involving comparisons of the rectangles' coordinates.
- [Mirror Reflection:](https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/) A physics problem that can be solved geometrically. You need to determine which mirror a laser beam will hit in a room with mirrored walls, given the room’s dimensions and the laser’s entry point. This problem involves understanding the properties of reflections and geometry.

## Codeforces Geometry Problems
- [Fancy Fence:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/270/A) Given an angle, determine if it is possible to construct a regular polygon with that angle. This problem tests knowledge of polygon properties and basic geometry.
- [Pashmak and Garden:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/459/A) Given the coordinates of two distinct points, determine if they can form a square with two other points, and if so, find the coordinates of those points. Involves basic coordinate geometry.
- [Okabe and Future Gadget Laboratory:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/821/A) Determine if a given matrix can be transformed into another matrix using a certain set of operations, which can be approached by considering geometric transformations of the indices.
- [Parallelepiped:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/224/A) Given the areas of three faces of a parallelepiped that meet at one corner, find the dimensions of the parallelepiped. It requires solving a system of equations derived from geometric relations.
