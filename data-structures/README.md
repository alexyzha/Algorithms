## LeetCode Data Structures Problems
- [LRU Cache:](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/) Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. Implement the LRUCache class which includes operations for adding a key-value pair, retrieving a value, and ensuring the capacity does not exceed a set limit by removing the least recently used items.
- [Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree:](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/) Design an algorithm to serialize a binary tree into a string and then deserialize that string back into the original tree structure. It tests understanding of tree traversal and string manipulation techniques.
- [Merge k Sorted Lists:](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/) Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. This problem evaluates the ability to manipulate linked lists and utilize data structures like heaps to efficiently merge lists.
- [Design Twitter:](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/) Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow another user, and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the user's news feed. Your design should support these functions in an efficient manner.

## Codeforces Data Structures Problems
- [Registration System:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/C) A system where new users can register with a unique username. If a username is already taken, the system should append a number to make it unique. This problem tests knowledge of hash maps or dictionaries.
- [Xenia and Bit Operations:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/339/D) A problem involving a segment tree where operations are performed on the segments, and the type of operation alternates between OR and XOR. It assesses the understanding of segment tree construction and lazy propagation.
- [Sereja and Suffixes:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/368/B) Given an array, for each i, find the number of distinct elements in the subarray starting from i to the end of the array. Requires efficient manipulation of data structures to avoid timeout errors.
- [Greg and Array:](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/295/A) An array manipulation problem that involves applying multiple operations and queries efficiently, suitable for understanding and implementing segment trees or difference arrays.
